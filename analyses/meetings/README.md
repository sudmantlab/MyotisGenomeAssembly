- David will finish the annotations by the end of the week
    - we repair these w/ David's pipeline
    - these will be the final annotations
- There are several holes which are annotated in all but one genome. How to fix?
    - mask the annotations that exist, and blast them against the genomes to fill holes, you find missing genes that are homologs
    - David will run this
    - this will create a NEW set for evolutionary analyses (BLAT complement)
- He will share the macse alignments as well
- he will run HyPhy
- **we will run RER converge (John)**
- David will use a Velifer centric approach for genes
- Manny will build the distribution of trees
    - also begin looking at structural changes
- David will send the Cactus alignments
- Elise will upload the species tree
